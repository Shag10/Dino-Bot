# Dino-Bot
Created Dinobot in python, which automatically plays chrome dinosaur game. It is built on the concept of image processing.  
# Requirements  
1. Python 3.x   
2. Pyautogui module. (This module allows you to automatically press the required keys on your keyboard)  
3. Pillow module. (This module is used for image processing)  
# Cammands to install modules (through command line)  
#### Pyautogui --  
pip install pyautogui  
#### Pillow -- 
pip install pillow  
# Important Points  
-- The hit box I created for detection of objects(obstacles) may vary from screen to screen. So you have to adjust that accordingly. I have labelled it within the code as well where the chages have to made.  
-- This program works on trial and error, so it might take many changes to make it good functioning bot.
